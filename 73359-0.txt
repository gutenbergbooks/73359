PROTEA CORDATA.

_Heart-shape-leaved Protea._


CLASS IV. ORDER I.

_TETRANDRIA MONOGYNIA._ Four Chives. One Pointal.


ESSENTIAL GENERIC CHARACTER.

COROLLA 4-fida, seu 4-petala. Antheræ lineares, insertæ petalis infra
apicem. Calyx, proprius, nullus. Semina solitaria.

BLOSSOM four-cleft or four petals. Tips linear, inserted into the petals
below the ends. Cup, proper, none. Seeds solitary.

See PROTEA FORMOSA, Pl. XVII. Vol. I.


SPECIFIC CHARACTER.

Protea foliis cordatis.

Protea with heart-shaped leaves.


REFERENCE TO THE PLATE.

1. A Floret before the petals have separated, natural
size.
2. The same, magnified, after the bursting of the petals.
3. The Pointal and Seed-bud, natural size.


The Heart-shape-leaved Protea was introduced to Britain in the year
1792, from the Cape of Good Hope, by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy; at whose
nursery it is now, this present month of March, 1803, in flower for the
first time in this country. The plant is only found on the mountains of
that part of the Cape called Hottentots Holland; the stem, in its native
state, laying on the ground, seldom more than a foot in length, and the
flowers proceeding from it near its base. It is rather delicate, should
be kept in a very airy part of the green-house, and planted in a light
loamy soil. It is propagated by cuttings, made in the month of April,
and kept under a common hand-glass, the pot being plunged in a shady
border.

Of this Protea there is a good figure in Thunberg’s _Dissertatio de
Protea_, Upsal, quarto edition, 1781, Plate 5, fig. 1.

PLATE CCXC.

APONOGETON DISTACHYON.

_Broad-leaved Aponogeton._


CLASS XI. ORDER IV.

_DODECANDRIA TETRAGYNIA._ Twelve Chives. Four Pointals.


GENERIC CHARACTER.

CALYX nullus, nisi squama spathacea externum latus floris cingens,
simplex, sessilis, ovata, obtusa, integra, erecta, glabra, colorata.

COROLLA nulla.

STAMINA. Filamenta undecim ad novemdecim, superioribus floribus
pauciora, intra spatham et capsulas inserta, subulata, glabra, alba,
spatha multoties breviora. Antheræ erectæ, bifidæ.

PISTILLA. Germina plerumque quatuor, raro tria seu quinque. Styli nulli.
Stigmata subulata, incurvata.

PERICARPIUM. Capsulæ quatuor, rarius tres seu quinque, ovatæ,
subulato-acutæ, exteriore latere gibbæ, interiore planæ, glabræ,
unilocularis.

SEMINA, in quacumque capsula tria, basi capsula affixa, sessilia,
obovata, obtusissima, sub-compressa, glabra.

EMPALEMENT none, except a sheathing scale surrounding the outer side of
the flower, simple, sitting close, egg-shaped, obtuse, intire, upright,
smooth, coloured.

BLOSSOM none.

CHIVES. Threads eleven to nineteen, in the upper flowers fewer, inserted
between the spathe and the capsules, awl-shaped, smooth, white, much
shorter than the spathe. Tips upright, two-cleft.

POINTALS. Seed-buds often four, seldom three or five. Shafts none.
Summits awl-shaped, turned inwards.

inversely egg-shaped, very blunt, rather flattish, smooth.


SPECIFIC CHARACTER.

Aponogeton spica bifida; foliis eliptico-lanceolatis, natantibus;
bracteis integris; floribus polyandris.

Aponogeton with a two-branched spike; leaves eliptically lance-shaped,
floating; floral leaves entire; flowers with many chives.


REFERENCE TO THE PLATE.

1. A Floret, with its floral leaf, magnified.

2. The Seed-buds and Summits, magnified.


This Genus of Plants in the Catalogue of the Kew Garden, is placed to
the Class Heptandria, and perhaps, with as much propriety as where it
now stands in Thunberg, Schreber, &c. for the number of chives in almost
every floret differs in this, and all the other species, from six to
twenty. It is there said to have been introduced to us in 1788 from the
Cape of Good Hope by Mr. F. Masson. It is found near Cape Town in most
of the brooks; is very sweet scented, and flowers from April till
November. As an aquatic it is very desirable for those who cultivate
those plants, the fragrance of the flowers being nearly equal to our
Nymphæa alba, or White Water Lily; and this, added to the contrasted
effect of the deep brown antheræ upon the pure white floral leaves,
which indeed have the appearance of blossoms, give the whole an
indescribable trait of beauty, peculiar to itself. Our figure was taken
from a plant in the Hibbertian collection.

SENECIO PSEUDO-CHINA.

_China-root Groundsel._


CLASS XIX. ORDER II.

_SYNGENESIA POLYGAMIA SUPERFLUA._ Tips united. Superfluous Pointals.

contiguous, equal, the base tiled by a few scales, dead at the ends.

BLOSSOM. Compound, taller than the cup; Hermaphrodite florets tubular,
numerous in the disk; Female florets (if there are any) tongue-shaped in
the circumference.

_Hermaphrodite_ florets funnel shaped, border reflexed, five-cleft.

_Female florets_ (if any) oblong, obscurely three-toothed.

CHIVES. Of the hermaphrodite florets; five threads, hair-like, very
small. Tips forming a tubular cylinder.

REFERENCE TO THE PLATE.

1. The Cup.

2. A Female floret, of the ray or circumference.

3. A Pointal of the female floret magnified.

4. An Hermaphrodite floret of the disk or centre.

5. The Chives and Pointal of an Hermaphrodite floret, magnified.

The roots of this plant were received at the same time with the double
Camellias, China Roses, &c. from China, by the late J. Slater, Esq. of
Laytonstone, Essex; we have, nevertheless, good reason to believe it was
known formerly in our gardens; but has been certainly lost, for many
years, to us. It is said to have been cultivated by James Sherrard, M.
D. in 1732, as copied from Dellinens’s Hortus Elthamensis, into the Kew
Catalogue. Miller speaks of it as flowering freely, and perfecting its
seeds; whereas, in the Hort. Kew. they omit its time of flowering,
which, had it ever flowered there, would certainly have been noted. Our
drawing was taken in the month of July last year, 1802, from a plant in
the Hibbertian Collection, the first and only time we have ever seen it
flower in England. It is propagated by the roots, which are large and
fleshy; the plant is herbaceous, and should have but little water during
the winter months, as the roots are very subject to rot; they are
imported from India as a drug, under the name of China-root. Must be
kept in the hot-house, and planted in rich earth.

PLATE CCXCII.

GERANIUM UNDULATUM.

_Waved-flowered Geranium._


CLASS XVI. ORDER IV.

_MONADELPHIA DECANDRIA._ Threads united. Ten Chives.


ESSENTIAL GENERIC CHARACTER.

MONOGYNA. Stigmata quinque. Fructus rostratus, penta-coccus.

ONE POINTAL. Five Summits. Fruit furnished with long awns, five dry
berries.


SPECIFIC CHARACTER.

Geranium foliis lanceolatis ciliatis, sub-integris; petalis
sub-æqualibus, sub-linearibus, undulatis; floribus umbellatis,
pentandris; radice tuberosa.

Geranium with lance-shaped flowers, fringed nearly intire; petals almost
equal, nearly linear, waved; flowers grow in umbels, five fertile
chives; root tuberous.


REFERENCE TO THE PLATE.

1. The Empalement cut open, to shew its tubular structure.

2. The Chives and Pointal, natural size.

3. The Chives, magnified and cut open.

4. The Pointal and Seed bud, magnified.

This tuberous rooted Geranium, from the Cape of Good Hope, has some
affinity with the G. spathulatum, as to the shape of the leaves; but the
whole habit of the plant is so totally different, that we could not,
with any degree of propriety, consider it as a variety of that species.
Our figure was taken from a plant in the Hibbertian collection, to which
it was introduced in the year 1800, by Mr. Niven. It flowers in June,
and may be propagated by the root. The treatment is the same as that
required for the rest, of this division, of the Genus.

PLATE CCXCIII.

LACHNÆA PURPUREA.

_Purple-flowered Lachnæa._


CLASS VIII. ORDER I.

_OCTANDRIA MONOGYNIA._ Eight Chives. One Pointal.


ESSENTIAL GENERIC CHARACTER.

CALYX nullus. Corolla quadrifida; limbo inæquali. Semen unum,
sub-baccatum.

CUP none. Blossom four-cleft; border unequal. One seed, like a berry.

See LACHNÆA ERIOCEPHALA, Pl. CIV. Vol. II.


SPECIFIC CHARACTER.

Lachnæa capitulis solitariis; corollis glabris, purpureis; foliis
trigonis, obtusis, quadrifariam imbricatis.

Lachnæa with solitary heads of flowers; blossoms smooth, purple; leaves
three-sided, obtuse, tiled in four-rows.


REFERENCE TO THE PLATE.

1. One of the floral Leaves, which surround the head of flowers at the
base.

2. A Flower complete.

3. A Blossom cut open, the lower part cut off, to shew the insertion of
the Chives at the mouth.

4. The Pointal, natural size.

5. The same magnified.

This most singular genus of plants, in external appearance so resembling
passerina, yet so perfectly distinct in the parts of fructification, is
certainly amongst the handsomest of the natural order in which it ranks.
The long slender chives which extend nearly to the length of the border
of the blossom, independent of the singular retrofraction of one of its
segments, give it a character, we think, decidedly sufficient on which
to have formed the Genus. This is the third species known; it was
introduced to the Hibbertian collection, in 1800, by Mr. Niven, from the
Cape of Good Hope. It is a very delicate plant, subject to be destroyed
by damps, flowers in July, and may be increased by cuttings. It thrives
best in a mixture of light sand and loam.

Thunberg, in his Prod. Plant. Cap. has referred the whole genus to
Passerina.

PLATE CCXCIV.

PROTEA CANDICANS.

_Hoary-leaved Protea._


CLASS IV. ORDER I.

_TETRANDRIA MONOGYNIA._ Four Chives. One Pointal.


ESSENTIAL GENERIC CHARACTER.

COROLLA 4-fida, seu 4-petala. Antheræ lineares, insertæ petalis infra
apicem. Calyx proprius, nullus. Semina solitaria.

BLOSSOM 4-cleft, or 4 petals. Tips linear, inserted into the petals
below the point. Cup, proper, none. Seeds solitary.

See PROTEA FORMOSA, Pl. XVII. Vol. I.


SPECIFIC CHARACTER.

Protea foliis apicibus tridentatis, eliptico-lanceolatis, obliquis,
candidissimis; capitulis terminalibus; calyx imbricatus, squamis acutis;
corollis luteis.

Protea with leaves three-toothed at the ends, eliptically-lance-shaped,
oblique and very hoary; heads of flowers terminal; cup tiled, scales
pointed, blossoms yellow.


REFERENCE TO THE PLATE.

1. A Floret, the petals separated, natural size.

2. One of the Petals magnified.

3. The Pointal, and Seed-bud, natural size, the Summit detached,
magnified.

4. The Empalement, natural size.

Our present plant is one of the rarest Proteas at this time in England;
as, we believe, there has never been but one importation of the seeds
from the Cape, and no one species of this numerous genus is with more
difficulty propagated by cuttings. Its lower leaves are apt to suffer
much from damps in winter; in consequence, the stem becomes bare till
near the top; the plant grows about three feet high, and flowers in
August, or September. Our figure was taken from the Hibbertian
collection, where it flowered, in 1802, for the first time in Britain.
We owe its introduction to Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, Hammersmith, about
the year 1790. We have our doubts of this plant being the P. tomentosa
of Thunberg; for although he, in his description of that species, comes
nigh many of the characters of P. candicans, yet his determining the
leaves to be linear, and downy, and our having drawings, taken from two
other species, approaching this in habit, yet nigher affined to P.
tomentosa, we have retained his specific title for one of them, the
other yet unnamed; which will both be given in due course.

PASSIFLORA AURANTIA.

_Norfolk Island Passion-Flower._


CLASS XX. ORDER IV.

_GYNANDRIA PENTANDRIA._ Chives on the Pointal. Five Chives.


ESSENTIAL GENERIC CHARACTER.

TRIGYNA. Calyx 5-phyllus. Petala 5. Nectarium corona. Bacca pedicellata.

THREE styles. Cup 5-leaved. Petals 5. Honey-cup forming a crown. Berry
standing on a foot-stalk.

See Pl. CCVII. PASSIFLORA MALIFORMIS. Vol. IV.


SPECIFIC CHARACTER.

Passiflora foliis trilobis, lobis oblongis obtusis, medio longiore;
petiolis biglandulosis; nectario cylindraceo, denticulato; corolla
aurantia.

Passion-Flower with three-lobed leaves; lobes oblong, obtuse, the middle
one the longest; foot-stalks with two glands; honey-cup cylindrical and
toothletted; blossom orange-coloured.


REFERENCE TO THE PLATE.

1. Exhibits the half of a flower as cut perpendicularly through the
middle, with the whole of the Pointal and Chives in their place.


This species of Passion Flower, from Norfolk Island, was introduced to
Britain in the year 1792, and was first raised, from seeds, at the
Hammersmith Nursery. It is a greenhouse plant, loving heat and drought,
thrives in a light sandy soil, and is readily increased by cuttings;
which should be placed in the heat of the bark-bed in the hothouse, or
cucumber hot-bed, in the month of April.

In the young state of the plant, the leaves are less harsh, appear
rather scolloped than lobed, and much resemble in shape those of the
Maiden-hair Fern, or Adiantum Capillus-veneris; whence the trivial name,
_adiantifolia_, which it bears in most collections. But, as there can be
no doubt of our present plant being that designed by Forster, in his
Prod. flor. insul. austral. No. 326; of Cavanilles in his Dissertationes
classis Monadelphiæ, Diss. 10. p. 457; and as lastly quoted by
Willdenow, in his new Sp. Plant. Tom. 3, Part 1, p. 620; we have,
without hesitation, adopted the specific title it there bears. As an
addition to the very few handsome climbing plants fit to decorate the
trellis-work of our modern greenhouses, or conservatories, this plant
must be considered as a great acquisition; as the growth is rapid, the
foliage of a fine green, and the flowering abundant.

Our figure was taken from a plant in the conservatory of the Hibbertian
collection, Clapham common.

COROLLA 6-partita, infera; petalis tribus interioribus longioribus.
Stamina erecta. Capsula subovata, trialata. Semina globosa.

BLOSSOM 6-divided, beneath; the three inner petals the longest. Chives
erect. Capsule nearly egg-shaped, three-winged. Seeds globular.

See LACHENALIA PENDULA, Pl. XLI. Vol. I.


SPECIFIC CHARACTER.

Lachenalia foliis binis, lanceolato-linearibus, obtusis; petalis
interioribus longioribus; scapo lævi filiforme; corollis roseis.

Lachenalia with two leaves between, lance and linear-shaped, obtuse; the
inner petals the longest; flower-stem smooth and thread-shaped; blossoms
rose-coloured.


REFERENCE TO THE PLATE.

1. A Blossom cut open, shewn from the inside, the Chives in their place.

2. The same, shewn from the outside.

3. The Seed-bud and Pointal, natural size.

This plant we believe to be perfectly new to Britain, and in no other
collection, at present, than that of G. Hibbert, Esq. Clapham; where the
drawing of our figure was taken in May, 1802; and to which it had been
added, the preceding year, by Mr. Niven, from the Cape of Good Hope.

It is a tender bulb, and rather impatient of moisture; increases by the
bulb; should not be removed from its pot but to give it fresh earth, and
is fond of a light, loamy soil. It is without scent.

NYMPHÆA ODORATA.

_Sweet-scented Water-Lily._


CLASS XIII. ORDER I.

_POLIANDRIA MONOGYNIA._ Many Chives. One Pointal.


ESSENTIAL GENERIC CHARACTER.

CALYX 4, 5, seu 6-phyllus. Corolla polypetala. Bacca multi-locularis,
truncata.

Cup 4, 5, or 6-leaved. Blossom many petals. Berry many-celled, appearing
cut off at top.

See NYMPHÆA CÆRULEA, Pl. CXCVII. Vol. III.


SPECIFIC CHARACTER.

Nymphæa foliis subrotundis, integris emarginatis, lobis divaricatis,
obtusissimis, margine parum incurvatis; calyce tetraphyllo; flore albo.

Water Lily with almost round leaves, entire, and notched at the end;
lobes straddling, very obtuse, and turned up slightly at the edge; cup
four-leaved; flower white.


REFERENCE TO THE PLATE.

1. A Chive.

2. The Seed-bud and Summits.

3. The Seed-bud cut transversely.

This species of Water-Lily we should consider rather as a variety, than
as a distinct species; it has every character of our common white
Water-Lily, except the size and hardiness; it has the same powerful
fragrance, but will not stand the severity of our winters. It is a
native of Carolina and Virginia, North America; was introduced to us in
the year 1786, by William Hamilton, Esq. of Philadelphia, and flowers
during the summer months, if kept in the hot-house. Requires the same
treatment as the blue species from the Cape of Good Hope. May be
increased from the seed, or from the root. Our drawing was taken from a
plant in the Clapham collection.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER.

Anthericum foliis hirsutis, planis, costatis, lineari-ensiformibus,
supra medium reflexis; scapo simplici, glabro; floribus albis; radice
bulboso.

Anthericum with hairy, flat, leaves, ribbed, linearly sword-shaped,
turned back from the middle; flower-stem simple, smooth; flowers white,
root bulbous.


REFERENCE TO THE PLATE.

1. The Chives and Pointal, magnified.

2. The Seed-bud, Shaft, and Summit, magnified.

3. The half of the Seed-bud cut transversely, magnified.

It is much to be lamented that we, as yet, have not discovered a mode of
treatment by which many of the species or Albuca, Ornithogalum,
Anthericum, &c. from the Cape, might be induced to flower with us, after
the first year from their importation; since many of them never produce
more than a few leaves afterwards; and this plant, we fear, is amongst
the number. It makes a very handsome and sweet bunch of flowers, which
have considerable duration, not less than a month from first expansion.
We can say little as to the propagation and culture; as it has not as
yet increased, nor has it produced any flowers since our drawing was
made, in August 1801. We think it is only in the Hibbertian Collection,
to which it was introduced by Mr. Niven, in 1800, from the Cape of Good
Hope.

Lachenalia with leaves between egg and lance-shaped, numerous; petals
equal, pointed, reflexed, and dotted with red spots; seed-bud with a
foot-stalk, and roundish.


REFERENCE TO THE PLATE.

1. One of the Petals, which are divided to the base, with its chive.

2. The Seed-bud, Shaft, and Summit, natural size.

3. The same, magnified.

This curious Lachenalia, for such it must be considered, though in many
parts widely different from congeners, is a native of the Cape of Good
Hope, and was received from thence in the year 1798, by J. Vere, Esq. of
Kensington Gore; in whose collection, we believe, it is only to be
found, and where our drawing was taken in the month of June 1801. It is
a tender bulb, and requires a considerable degree of heat to make it
flower, and does not appear to have any tendency to increase, although,
Mr. Anderson informs us, he has tried it in various situations and soils
to that end.

The round tufts of long hair which terminate the inner scales of the
cup, in this Protea, and its varieties, constitute its principal,
distinguishing specific character from P. speciosa; whose scales are
fringed at the summits, and to which our present plant is nearest
allied. It is, without doubt, one of the handsomest of this fine tribe
of plants; not only in the beauty of the blossom, but for its general
habit; as it does not grow above three feet high, very bushy, and
producing its flowers at the age of three or four years. It is increased
by cuttings only, as are most of the species of this extensive genus,
none of them perfecting their seeds in this climate, or producing roots
by laying the branches. Our drawing was made from a plant in the
Hibbertian collection, to which it was introduced in 1800, by Mr. Niven,
from the Cape of Good Hope, in the month of May, 1802.

and magnified.

2. The Seed-bud, Shaft and Summit.

3. The same, magnified.

4. The Seed-bud, cut transversely, magnified.

The extreme fragrance of this plant, amply compensates for its want of
beauty; it retains its sweetness through the whole period of its
flowering, which is of near a month’s continuance. There is a species of
this genus, much resembling our plant in flower, but nothing in the
leaf; it is known by the name of L. patens, and has been frequently sold
for this, but its scent is quite different, and it flowers much earlier;
that is to say, in the month of March, but the L. fragrans does not
produce its blossoms till May. It is a very hardy greenhouse bulb, and
requires no particular management to make it flower; this, however, it
does not do, but once in two years; not even appearing in foliage, but
in the second year from its flowering. Our figure was made at the
Hammersmith Nursery, to which it was introduced, from the Cape of Good
Hope, in the year 1798.

The singular bearded termination, on each tooth, of the leaflets of this
species of Geranium, has induced us to give it a specific title;
although, in many other respects, it approaches very near two or three
others, already figured, by us, of this long genus. It is from the same
country with the other tuberous species, and introduced to the
Hibbertian collection in 1800, where our drawing was made in July 1802.

This division of the butterfly flowered plants, from New Holland, was
among the first genera which were raised from the seeds of that country,
in Britain. And though we have possessed the plants so long, and both
species, or rather the two varieties, perfect their seeds with us; yet
are the plants very scarce, few of them are to be met with, and seldom
more than a plant, or two, is to be found in any collection. The
Daviesias grow about a foot and a half high, and when in flower make a
very pretty appearance, as nearly the whole bush is covered with
blossoms. They are rather tender, and are impatient of wet, which is,
perhaps, the greatest enemy many of the plants from that country have to
encounter with us. It flowers about April or May; is increased by seeds,
or cuttings; should be kept in a small pot, comparatively with what may
be used for the same sized plants, and planted in sandy peat. Our
drawing was made from the Hibbertian collection, in the month of May
1802.

The drawing of this Geranium was taken at Clapham in the month of July,
1802, from a plant in the Hibbertian collection, where, we believe, it
is only to be met with, and to which it was introduced, in 1801, from
the Cape of Good Hope. It has no particular character, in its
appearance, from which we might be led to think any other treatment or
mode of culture necessary for this plant, different from the rest of its
congeners.

ALETRIS FRAGRANS.

_Sweet-scented Aletris._


CLASS VI. ORDER I.

_HEXANDRIA MONOGYNIA._ Six Chives. One Pointal.


ESSENTIAL GENERIC CHARACTER.

COROLLA infundibuliformis, rugosa. Stamina inserta laciniarum basi.
Capsula trilocularis.

BLOSSOM funnel-shaped, wrinkled. Chives inserted into the base of the

See ALETRIS SARMENTOSA, Pl. LIV.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER.

Aletris caulescens; foliis lanceolatis, laxis; floribus albicantibus,
fragrantissimis.

Aletris with a woody stem; leaves lance-shaped, loose; flowers whitish,
very sweet-scented.


REFERENCE TO THE PLATE.

1. A miniature representation of the whole plant.

2. A flower complete, natural size.

3. The blossom cut open, with the Chives in their place.

4. The Seed-bud, Shaft and Pointal; the summit detached, magnified.

The Sweet-scented Aletris, from the great height it attains before it
flowers, which is, from 9 to 12 feet, and nearly two-thirds of the
length of the stem, without leaves; takes off much from the merit of
this grand plant as cultivated in our colder regions. It is a native of
Africa, and must be kept in the hot-house, in the bark-bed, to have it
blossom. The flowers are extremely fragrant, open in the evening and
close again with the first rays of the morning sun. It is propagated
either by suckers, which it sometimes produces, or by cutting off small
portions from the roots; which will become plants in about three months,
if placed in the heat of a strong hot-bed; these are likewise very
sweet-scented, having the flavour of orris-root, or violets. Our figure
was taken from a plant in the collection of J. Vere, Esq. Kensington
Gore, this present month of May, 1803.

A schism has arisen on the subject of this genus among modern botanists;
from whom we must, however, exclude the celebrated author of Miller’s
New Gardeners’ Dictionary; who, in this instance, has preserved the
genus entire. Three genera have, as usual, been made out of one; the
Cape species are denominated Veltheimias; those known under the names of
A. zeylanica and A. guineensis, are termed Sansevieras; A. farinosa and
A. fragrans being the only remnants of the original genus. Such are the
happy effects, of modern scrutiny, upon the works of the antiquated
Linnæus! and such might be the answer of these illuminati, which poor
Gradus, in the farce of _Who’s the Dupe_, gives to his mistress, when
questioned upon the utility of his labours; alas, how else should _our_
merit be discovered, but by elancing from the old track of plain sense
and nature.

5. The common Empalement.

This species of Protea, though it does not stand among the foremost of
its congeners in competition for beauty; yet, has its merits, and those
of no small moment, as a hardy green-house plant; for it rarely misses
flowering, in the month of May, annually, and its blossoms continue in
perfection at least two months. It is seldom hurt by cold or wet, if not
exposed to either in the extreme. Is easily propagated from cuttings,
made in the month of May, or June; by the same mode as has been
described for the increasing the preceding species of the Genus, already
figured in this work. We owe the first introduction of this plant to
Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, Hammersmith, who raised it from seeds, in the
year 1786, received from the Cape of Good Hope. Our figure was made from
a plant in the Hibbertian collection.

This handsome annual is an old inhabitant of our hot-houses, for it has
been cultivated so long ago as the year 1731, by Mr. Miller; but from
its character as an annual, our summers not proving always congenial to
the perfecting its seeds, it has at intervals been lost to us. It is a
native of the East Indies, and, in general, good seed may be procured by
keeping the plants constantly in a hot-bed or hot-house; but the best
method is to raise them on a strong hot-bed, keeping them there till in
flower, and then transferring them to the hot-house or dry-stove, to
perfect their seeds. Our drawing was taken from a fine specimen,
communicated by the Hon. W. H. Irby, from his select collection at the
Parsonage, Farnham Royal, Bucks. Flowers in May or June, and ripens its
seeds in August or September.

Where to place the limits to the various new genera of this very
extended natural order of plants, with butterfly blossoms, from New
Holland, appears a talk of some difficulty with our modern botanists;
for, no sooner have we formed an essential character for a genus, than
immediately we are struck with the appearance of new plants, whose whole
habits assimilate with our newly constructed family, but in the
principal and pointed essential character. In such predicament stands
our present subject, it wants the appendicula to the cup, yet has it
been placed, by Willdenow, &c. to Pultenæa; and with good reason, we
presume, for if every difference of this nature was taken up, on which
to form new genera, nearly every plant from that country would furnish
grounds for new names; and, to say the truth, we think they are,
already, sufficiently extended. The Pultenæas are all rather impatient
of wet, and although they are not frequently killed by too much
moisture, yet they become unsightly, by losing all their lower leaves.
This species grows to the height of about three feet; and, when in
flower, makes a very handsome appearance. It perfects its seeds, and may
be increased by cuttings, which should be put in about the beginning of
April. A mixture of sandy peat three parts, and one fourth part of loam,
is the best soil to grow it in. It was amongst the first plants which
were raised from Botany Bay seeds in this country. Our figure was made
at the Hammersmith nursery, in 1801.

Although this species of Stachys must be considered as an herbaceous
plant, yet the stem, if kept in the green-house, may be preserved; and
therefore, as it is too tender to bear our winters, in the open ground,
we must consign it to that station. It is a native of South America; is
easily propagated by cuttings; flowers in the month of July, or August,
and thrives in rich mould. The figure was taken from a plant in the
collection of J. Vere, Esq. Kensington Gore, where, we believe, it
flowered for the first time in Britain.

The specific title of this plant, originally, belonged to a species
which is, now, confounded amongst the numerous variety of Geranium
lacerum. And, indeed, the present plant is taken as a synonim, by
Willdenow, with G. astragalifolium, of which we have given a figure in a
preceding number. This was among the first of the tuberous kind of
Geraniums known to our gardens. Mr. F. Masson, according to the Kew
Catalogue, first introduced it to the Kew Gardens in 1788. It has
nothing particular in its character to require a different treatment
from the rest of the tuberous species. Our drawing was made from a plant
in the Hammersmith Collection, in March 1801.

2. A Blossom, with the Chives in their place, cut open.

3. The Seed-bud, Shaft, and Summit, the Summit magnified.

Few of the plants from New Holland have excited more admiration than the
Styphelias; the S. tubiflora figured in the New Holland botany of Dr.
Smith, the S. triflora given in the first Vol. of this work, our present
plant, together with the numerous other species already known from dried
specimens, lead us to conjecture that the genus is as copious as any,
Banksia not excepted, from that country. This plant grows to the height
of two feet, or more; the flowers nearly covering the branches. It is
rather delicate, requiring but little water, in the winter months; as it
is certain to perish, if kept wet any considerable time. Is propagated
by cuttings, and must be kept in a small pot, proportional to the size
of the plant, in very sandy peat earth. Our figure was taken from a
plant in the Hibbertian collection, in the month of April, 1803. All the
plants, at present in Britain, of this species of Styphelia, are the
offspring of one solitary seed, received by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy from
New Holland, in the year 1791.

3. An unripe Seed.

Most of the species of this genus of plants have hitherto been
considered of little value in our collections, as few of them have woody
stems, and from that character have a weedy appearance. This plant
however is an exception, and is well worthy a place in collections where
ornament only, not variety, is studied. It grows to the height of three
feet, flowers in the month of August, is easily increased from cuttings,
and may be kept in the hot-house, out of the bark-bed. The Justicia
coccinea and this plant approach in the appearance of their flowers and
habit; but the leaves differ much as well as many other minuter parts.
It is a native of the East Indies, and was introduced about the year
1794. Our figure was taken from a plant in the Collection of G. Hibbert,
Esq. Clapham Common.

This plant is a native of New Holland, and was introduced from thence by
the Right Honourable the Marchioness of Rockingham, at the same time
with the Bauera rubioides of this work; and from a specimen communicated
by her Ladyship in September, 1801, our drawing was taken. It is a hardy
green-house plant, continuing in flower from August till December; makes
a very bushy handsome shrub, especially when planted in a conservatory.
Is easily propagated by cuttings, made in the month of April, and kept
on a gentle heat until they are rooted. It thrives most in sandy peat,
with a small mixture of sandy loam.

This singular little Orchis was first introduced to us, from the Cape of
Good Hope, by Mr. F. Masson, in 1787, but has been lost to our gardens
since near that time till last year, when we had the pleasure of seeing
it again in the collection of T. Evans, Esq. Stepney; but we much fear,
without a fresh supply of roots, it will again soon stand but as a name
in our catalogues. It is a very tender and delicate plant; and, like
nearly the whole of this natural order, difficult to propagate or
preserve in a cultivated state; wherefore we cannot pretend to recommend
any particular method. The bulb which flowered at Stepney was planted in
sandy peat, and appeared in good health. It flowers in September, loses
its leaves soon after flowering, and is extremely fragrant.

Our present figure represents a plant a native of New Holland and New
Zealand, in the Pacific Ocean; but, we have great reason to think, it
has been referred, rather rashly, to the genus under which it is here
named; and that it possesses a distinctive character sufficient on which
to have formed a new one. We have, nevertheless, as usual, taken it up
under the title it is in general known by, as published by Vahl, in his
Symbolæ Botanicæ, Part III. p. 3, and quoted from him into Willdenow’s
Sp. Plant. p. 46, and thence into Professor Martyn’s ed. of Miller’s
Dict. article Olea, 5. Whether the fruit of this plant will ever turn to
account, when cultivated, as an article of food, time must evince; but,
certainly, it bears an appearance of much hope. It is a strong woody
growing shrub, forming itself into a handsome round-headed plant; and,
when in full flower, has a very pretty appearance, having all the
necessary qualities of such plants as are fit for planting out in a
conservatory. It is propagated by cuttings; should be planted in sandy
peat earth, mixed with a small portion of loam; producing its flowers
about February or March. Our drawing was made from a plant in the
Hammersmith Collection, to which it was first added in the year 1791;
having been raised from seeds communicated to Messrs. Lee and Kennedy by
Colonel Paterson.

This very handsome tuberous Geranium, and which we have rather placed as
a variety than a species, might perhaps by some have been considered as
sufficiently distinct to have formed a species; but, indeed, much
difficulty arises in the determining, amongst this variable tribe, where
to fix determinate specific character. Our present figure was taken from
the Hibbertian Collection, where as yet the plant is only to be seen in
Britain. It flowers in June or July; does not perfect its seeds, nor has
the appearance of easily propagating from the root; the usual method
with this link of the Geranium family. It thrives in sandy peat and leaf
mould.

This plant is said to have been in our European gardens so long ago as
the year 1603: having, at that time, been sent to Paris by the younger
Robin from Guinea. But however this may be, as yet there is no figure of
the plant by which it may be known from many of this beautiful tribe,
except the one by the late Mr. Nodder. We are indebted for its last
introduction to the honourable the Sierra Leone Company, who received,
in 1792, the roots of this plant, amongst many others, from that
settlement; which were by them presented to Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, at
Hammersmith. Our figure was taken in June from a plant in flower this
present year, 1803, in the collection of J. Vere, Esq. Kensington Gore,
where, from particular management of Mr. Anderson, the same root has
flowered several times; a circumstance that but rarely happens with
these bulbs after the first year from importation. As a native of so hot
a clime it must be kept in the bark bed of the hot-house; and, when the
plant is not in flower, should be watered but sparingly. We as yet are
unacquainted with any mode by which it may be propagated. It flourishes
most in rich mould. Our figure represents the plant in a small specimen,
as the head of flowers is frequently, in this country, of three times
the size.

This pretty plant is a native of New Holland, and was first received in
seeds from thence under the name of Indigofera coccinea, in the year
1800, by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, Hammersmith. It grows into a bushy
plant, making a number of branches from the root, but is rather a woody
than herbaceous plant; yet the branches have all the character of most
of the species of this genus. It has not as yet been increased by
cuttings, but from every appearance the seeds will ripen in this
country; and there is little doubt but the roots may be divided with
safety. It flourishes in a mixture of sandy peat and loam. Our figure
was taken from a plant in the Collection of Messrs. Colvilies, King’s
Road, Chelsea; where it has likewise flowered this present August,
1803.

This species of Pultenæa was introduced, from New Holland, about the
year 1792, by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, Hammersmith, and is undoubtedly
one of the handsomest of the genus. It is difficult to increase as the
seeds do not mature, and it is very rarely propagated by cuttings. It
grows to the height of three or four feet; and, when in flower, makes a
very brilliant appearance. It is not a long-liv’d plant; is very
impatient of wet, and is easily hurt by the cold, so should be kept in a
dry and warm part of the green-house, or even on a shelf in the
hot-house, during the winter months. It thrives in very sandy peat earth
without any mixture. Our drawing was made from a plant in the Hibbertian
Collection, in the month of June, 1801.

This singular little bulbous rooted plant was received this year, 1803,
in the month of April, amongst a number of other curious new seeds and
bulbs, from the East-Indies, by Aylmer Bourke Lambert, Esq. by whom they
have been communicated to different collections. Although the plant has
considerable affinity with Arethusa, yet we entertain doubts whether it
should not be placed to Limodorum, as it wants many of the generic
characters of the former genus, and but few, and those but trivial in
its correspondence, to the latter. We have, notwithstanding, given it
the title under which it was sent, submitting our judgment to what we
conceive better authority. There is little doubt but the plant will soon
be lost in our collections, as but few of this natural order are either
to be propagated or kept by any cultivation we are at present acquainted
with. Our figure was taken from a plant which flowered in the hot-house
of J. Vere, Esquire, Kensington Gore, in the month of July, before there
was any appearance of either root or leaf from the bulb. It was in
flower at the same time in the Collection of Sir Abraham Hume, Bart.
Wormley-Bury, Herts.

does not flower so readily as some of the other species, but is equally
easy to increase; flourishes in rich earth, and may be kept on a shelf
of the hot-house until its flower-stem appears; when, to encourage its
flowering, it should be plunged in the bark-bed.--Our drawing was made,

This fine species of Magnolia is a native of China and Japan, was
introduced to us by the late Mr. Slater of Laytonstone, to whom we are
so much indebted for the greatest number of beautiful plants which have
been imported from thence by any individual. It is a very free growing
plant; will resist the severity of our winters, if planted in a warm
situation, and is deciduous; but if kept in the conservatory, it retains
its leaves the whole year, and flowers about June. It is propagated with
ease by laying, or by cuttings, and thrives in peat earth, with a small
mixture of loam. The plant from which our figure was taken is in the
magnificent Conservatory of the Right Honourable the Marquis of
Blandford, White Knights, near Reading, Berks; and, we believe, the
finest specimen of this species of Magnolia in Britain.

As an interesting desideratum, this plant has stood long amongst
botanical collectors; but till the year 1801, it was never seen, in a
vegetating state, in Britain; at which period, it was introduced to our
gardens, by Mr. Niven, from the Cape of Hope. It is not, we believe,
(although considered hitherto as such,) an annual; but rather, a half
woody shrub, easily destroyed by moisture. As the seed appears to ripen
freely, although there seems no other mode of perpetuating the plant, we
shall stand in no danger of losing it; its attractions are, indeed, not
great as to beauty, but much so as to singularity; since we have no
plant to which it affines in general habit. The seeds should be sown on
a gentle hot-bed, in March, and transplanted when about two inches high,
into pots, to flower, which they will do about September. Our drawing
was made at the Hammersmith Nursery. Having had the opportunity of
examining the flowers, of more than twenty plants; we are convinced it
has been wrong placed by Van Royen to decandria; for although many
flowers may be found, even on the same plant, some with eight, others
with ten chives, yet at least 90 out of 100 have twelve; wherefore we
have, without scruple, placed it to dodecandria.

This little plant much resembles our Corn Spurry, or Spergula arvensis,
at first sight. It is a native of the Cape of Good Hope, seldom grows
more than six inches high, and is very apt to be destroyed by the damps
of our winters. It should be placed in the airyest part of the
greenhouse, and kept in light sandy loam. To propagate it, the cuttings
should be put in, about the month of March, in the heat of a gentle
hot-bed, or the bark-bed of the hot-house; the seeds are sometimes
perfected. It has been often introduced to us, but as often lost; as it
is not a plant of much shew, no great deal of pains has, hitherto, been
taken for its preservation. Our drawing was taken from a plant in the
Hibbertian Collection, in the month of July, 1802.

This new species of Everlasting-flower was introduced to us, at the same
time, with the X. spirale this work, Pl. CCLXII. by Montague Burgoyne,
Esq. of Mark Hall, Essex, in the year 1801. It is a quick growing plant,
and has flowered for the first time last April, when our drawing was
taken. The flower stems grow to the length of eighteen inches, or more;
and the buds, upon their first appearance, have a fine tint of flesh
colour, which, however, totally disappears upon the expansion of the
flower. It is propagated by cuttings, seeds, (which ripen in this
country,) or by parting the branches at the root, as it makes many from
one base, which are easily separated by passing a knife between them. It
thrives best in sandy peat with a small portion of loam, and must be
kept in an airy, dry part of the greenhouse.

other, than in any which has come under our observation; having much the
appearance of those of the plant from which we have derived its specific
title. The plant was introduced by Mr. Niven, to the Clapham Collection,
in 1800; where our drawing was taken in the month of June, 1802. The

This fine species of Water-lily is a native of the East Indies, on the
Malabar coast; and has been given by Rheed, in his Hortus Malabaricus,
Vol. II. p. 53. fig. 27. At first sight, it has much the appearance of
N. cœrulea, but upon closer inspection it is found to possess many
strongly differing characters, viz. In this, the under part of the
leaves are purplish, the lobes straddle; in that, they are tiled, or lay
upon each other; in N. stellata the petals or chives seldom exceed ten;
whereas, the N. cœrulea has an indefinite number of both. The roots,
likewise, are perfectly distinct; in N. cœrulea the diverging roots
proceed from the lower part of the bulb, from whence the leaves issue,
but in N. stellata from the top, leaving below them a smooth top-shaped
bulb. The parts which compose the summit, or rather the summits, (for
indeed we should consider them, if it lay with us, as distinct
pointals,) are expanded horizontally when the flower is in its perfect
state, forming a star like appearance, whence its specific name. It is
much tenderer than N. cœrulea, and will not flower but in strong heat.
Mr. Anderson informs us that the plants which have produced perfect
seeds, this year, were from seeds, received by A. B. Lambert, Esq.
(communicated by Dr. Roxburgh from India) in the month of March, and
raised by him for the collection of J. Vere, Esq. Kensington Gore, where
our drawing was made in August.

It should seem that this Genus has not been observed with sufficient
accuracy, at least those plants known to us, and which have been treated
of as belonging to the class Pentandria. The present one, for instance,
which is unquestionably the plant designed by Swartz, Commelin, Seba,
&c. an is acknowledged by Swartz to be triandrous and monœcious, yet
that it should be continued in the Kew Catalogue and by Willdenow, &c.
to Pentandria, is astonishing. We have no hesitation in declaring our
opinion that the whole genus as it now stands ought to be thrown to
Phyllanthus. But, as the title Xylophylla is so well known for these
plants; we have thought it more safe to give the Genus those characters
the plants bear under their true Class and Order, than make any
alteration in it. The Xylophylla falcata is a native of the West India
Islands, and has been long cultivated in our hot-houses; so long ago as
the year 1739. It is a tender plant, and will not flower without the
assistance of the bark-bed; is easily propagated by cuttings; grows best
in sandy peat, and flowers in August. Our drawing was made at the
Hammersmith Nursery.

be propagated by cuttings, and flowers in August. It thrives best in a

All the species of this Genus of plants are aquatic, or water plants,
and differ but little from each other, in their specific characters. Our
present subject is a native of the West India Islands, and requires the
atmosphere of a hot-house to induce it to flower. The blossoms, on the
lower part of the flower-stem, are all females; and those on the upper
part, males; they are all exceedingly delicate, as either wind, or wet,
destroys them. It increases by offsets from the root; but the seeds do
not ripen in this country. It must be kept in a pan or tub half filled
with earth, and the other half with water, but does not require to be
plunged in the tan-bed.

Our figure was taken from a plant which flowered this year 1803 (and,
for the first time in Britain, as we are informed by Mr. Anderson), in
the month of July, in the Collection of J. Vere, Esq. Kensington Gore.

The Clapham Collection is the only one in which this curious species of
Struthiola is, at present, to be seen. It was sent by Mr. Niven, from
the Cape, in 1799, and flowered, for the first time, last year 1802, in
the month of August, when our drawing was made. It is a tender
Green-house plant, as are most of this natural order, from that country;
being susceptible of too great moisture, either when exposed to the open
air during heavy rains in summer, or from over watering in winter.
Wherefore they are best preserved by sheltering them in an airy
situation during summer, and giving them but little water in winter. It
is encreased by cuttings, taken off in the month of May, planted in a
pot, filled to the margin with sandy loam, and plunged under a
hand-glass, in a shady border, without watering the loam. It grows most
flourishing in a mixture of sandy peat and loam; the peat about one
third part.

Dowager Lady De Clifford, Paddington; where our drawing was taken in
August, this year, 1803. It grows to the height of three feet; and the
flowers continue to blow, from four to six at a time in succession, from
the base of the spike. It is a hardy bulb, and has every appearance of
being a free blower.

This is the only species of the Genus we have yet seen from the Cape of
Good Hope; and, as it appears that Thunberg discovered but this solitary
instance, which he has given in his Prodromus Plantarum Capensium, under
the specific title we have here adopted, from him; he, perhaps, thought
himself warranted in so naming it; although naming plants from the
country where they are first found requires but little reasoning to shew
its impropriety. It is a hardy green-house plant, but from all
appearance, like the most of this natural order, rather short-lived. It
grows freely in a mixture of loam and sandy peat; and there is every
appearance that the seeds will ripen, the only method by which there is
any likelihood of its being perpetuated.

The plant, before flowering, does not grow above six inches high; but
the flower-stem rises near eighteen inches. Our figure was taken from a
plant in the Hibbertian Collection; where it flowered for the first time
in England in the month of July 1803; having been sent home, by Mr.
Niven, from the Cape, in 1800.

This beautiful divided leaved Protea has been named, as above, by
Thunberg, in his Dissertatio de Protea, n. 7, and in his Prodromus
plantarum capensium 25. It is rather a delicate plant, and subject to
lose the lower leaves from the stem, which takes something from the
beauty of its habit. The young leaves, when they first appear, have a
downy character, which disappears as they grow firm. The stem has
likewise, in its young state, a tendency to downiness, which is not
discovered on the old wood; and is, where the leaves are extant, quite
covered by them. It grows to the height of three feet, is propagated by
cuttings, and flowers in the month of July. Our figure was taken from a
plant in the Hibbertian Collection, which was raised from Cape seeds in
1800, sent from thence by Mr. Niven.

The Geranium coronopifolium is one of those species we may fairly
denominate biennial; for such is certainly the G. tricolor, G.
Oenothera, G. tomentosum, &c. and as such must be propagated every year
to have a succession of them. It is readily increased by putting the
cuttings into small pots, and plunging them in the heat of a hot-bed or
hot-house, early in the month of March; which plants will flower in
September. It was first introduced to the Kew Gardens by Mr. Masson in
1792. The plant very delicate, and should be kept in a dry part of the
green-house, in a mixture of sandy peat and rich earth. Our figure is
from a plant in the Hibbertian Collection; where, likewise, we found the
variety of which a flower is given on the plate. Mr. Allen informs us,
he procured the Var. by approximating a plant of this species to the G.
tricolor; first impregnating the summits of the flower of G.
coronopifolium, with the pollen from the tips of the G. tricolor, a
method much practised of late for the production of varieties, in many
genera.

as shrubs. Our present subject is a biennial from the Cape of Good Hope,
flowers the first year from the seed, if sown in March, and may be
preserved a second year; but, as it seeds so abundantly, it is scarce
worth the pains to preserve it, as the plants of one year’s growth are
so much handsomer than those preserved through the winter. It flowers
from July till October, and should be kept in sandy peat earth.

The L. coronopifolia was introduced to the Kew Collection in 1787, by
Mr. F. Masson, and is now in most collections.

This most delicate little plant, of which our figure represents the
whole, was raised in 1801, from Cape seeds, sent by Mr. Niven from
thence, for the Clapham gardens; where our drawing was made this year,
1803, in the month of August. It is an annual plant, producing its seeds
freely, as do most species of this genus, which should be sown in the
month of March, in light sandy peat, and transplanted about May.

As a singular vegetable production, we have given a specimen of this
most curious flower, but not as a novelty, as it is, certainly, rather
common, the seeds having frequently been brought to us from Portugal,
(to which country it was first introduced from Brasil in South America),
ever since the year 1690. It is a climbing plant and must be kept in the
hot-house, is propagated by seeds or cuttings, grows to the height of 12
or 14 feet, and should be planted in rich earth. The flowers are
produced about August; they are very fragrant, but have not much
duration, and the plant has much the resemblance of the common scarlet
kidney-bean.

The Blandfordia cordata was first observed by Mr. J. Fraser, in the year
1786, on the banks of the Savannah river, near its source, in Georgia,
North America; but was not introduced to us until the year 1800, when it
was brought to England, amongst many other novelties, by that gentleman.
It is, as are most of the plants of that country, rather too tender to
resist the severity of our winters; and should be protected, either in
the green-house, or in the coolest and shadiest part of the hot-house;
where, if it is kept the year through, it will flourish, and flower
about the month of June. It is increased by parting the roots about
April; delights in moisture and shade; thriving most in a light peat
soil, with a small mixture of sandy loam. This plant, from its general
habit, would at first sight be taken for a species of Tiarella, or
Heuchera, to both which it bears great resemblance, being all, likewise,
natives of the same clime; but the strongly differing characters, in the
parts of fructification, prevent its being placed to either of those
genera. The honey-cup, it is true, might, perhaps, with reason, be
considered as the connected threads of ten chives, and what we take to
be the segments of its border, set down as so many sterile ones to make
up this number. Thus, the plant would be transmuted to the XVI class;
but, from our best judgment, we have placed it, as above, in the V.

Our figure is from a specimen communicated by the Right Hon. the Marquis
of Blandford, from his magnificent gardens at White Knights, near
Reading, Berks. Little need be urged for the propriety of our naming a
plant from the Marquis of Blandford; and thus, dedicating this small
part of our labours to his lordship; as few, at present, patronize the
science, through all its branches, with so much vigour and liberality,
or who have equal knowledge in its theory and practice.

The Sword-shaped-leaved Epidendrum is a native of China and Japan, was
cultivated, before 1792, in the gardens of the Marchioness of
Rockingham, at Hillindon, Middlesex. It has more the habit and character
of Limodorum than Epidendrum, to which genus it was first placed; and,
like the Epidendrum sinense of this work, Plate CCXVI. Vol. III.
requires but little heat to keep it in health; preferring a sandy loam
to any other matter, for its nourishment. It, like the forenamed, and
several other species of this genus, or rather of the genus Limodorum,
not being thick-leaved, or parasitic, where indigenous, are of
consequence much easier preserved and increased than those of that
description. Its flowers, which are produced in September or October,
are very fragrant, particularly in the evening, continue in perfection
above a month. It is propagated by parting the roots in the month of
May.

Our drawing was made from a plant in the Hibbertian Collection.

Amongst the plants, of this natural order, from the Cape of Good Hope,
we find such an intermixture of character, in the different parts of
fructification; that, if some latitude is not taken in referring them to
some of the old genera, almost every fresh subject, we discover, would
require a new one. This plant, although we have placed it to Hyacinthus,
with those that have gone before us, has juster claims to Drimia,
Polyanthes or Scilla; for it is wanting in the essential characters of
Hyacinthus, being unfurnished with the honied pores, and having the
chives inserted into the tube of the blossom, three of which are,
alternately, double the length of the others. To Drimia, a new genus of
Professor Jacquin, and a mutilation of Hyacinthus, it is most allied;
but, we have not thought fit to alter its known station, as, without
doubt, the multiplication of genera, or altering the place of known
plants, adds but to the difficulties of a most intricate, though
pleasing study. It is a hardy green-house bulb; delights in a mixture of
peat earth and sandy loam; increases by offsets, and flowers in October
or November. Our figure was made from a plant in the Nursery of Mr.
Williams of Turnham Green, who first imported it in 1800. It is said, by
Koenig, to grow in pasture lands near the Cape town, and was first
noticed there by him.

green-house plant, grows to the height of ten or twelve feet before it
flowers, which is in November. It is perfectly dioicous; the male and
female blossoms, never coming on the same plant, and either have little
to recommend them for beauty; their singularity is what should sooner
attract our notice. The two figures, on the plate, which are the male
and female, were taken from two plants, in flower, at the same time, in
the collection of the Dowager Lady de Clifford, Paddington. All the
species, hitherto discovered, since the first, upon which the genus was
formed, the C. equisetifolia has, like this, the male and female parts
of fructification on different plants; that only, being monoicous, or
with the male and female parts on the same plant.

This is a plant of considerable size at the Cape of Good Hope, so much
so, as to be looked upon there rather as a tree, than shrub. It was
first sent to England, in the year 1773, by Mr. F. Masson; is a hardy
green-house plant; thrives in a mixture of loam and peat, and flowers in
August, or September. There is no method, yet discovered, to propagate
it in this country; but, as seeds are so common of this plant, near Cape
town, there is scarce a parcel arrives, from thence, which does not
contain some of them.

Among the new modern vagaries in botany, this genus has been thought, by
the French botanists, (those admirable perplexers of natural order,) to
be better divided in two, as some of the species happen to have the
joints of the pods a little more swelled than others. How so trifling a
variation, and that in a part of the plant which is known to vary, in
almost every genus, through most of the species, where they are
numerous; should have been deemed of sufficient moment to alter the
names of so many established plants, and those determined by such
authority as Linnæus, we are at a loss to determine; and are equally
astonished that Willdenow should have followed them. The new genus is
termed Podalyria, and to which, this plant is attached in the new
system.

Our present subject stood formerly attached to the genus Guaiacum, under
the title of G. affrum, and has been long cultivated in Britain and
Holland, perhaps more than a century. Professor Jacquin, in his
_Collectanea ad Bot._ &c. Vol. I. p. 93, thought fit to constitute it a
new genus, naming it after his companion R. van der Schot. About the
same time, the year 1786, a monograph on this plant was published at
Manheim, by Fred. Casim. Medikus, under the name of Theodora Speciosa;
but Jacquin’s title has universally obtained. To preserve this plant in
good health, it should be kept in the coolest part of the hot-house, or
in a dry stove, the warmth of a common green-house being insufficient to
preserve its foliage through the winter months. It is a native of all
that extent of the African coast from Senegal river, to the Cape of Good
Hope, where it grows to the height of twenty feet and upwards. The
seeds, which are frequently imported, keep many years in a vegetative
state, and is, almost, the only method by which it can be propagated;
for little success can be hoped, either from layers, or cuttings. It
flowers from October till December, delighting in a light sandy loam.
Perhaps, no plant which has been as long in cultivation with us, has so
seldom been seen to flower; for, although the plants in the Kew gardens
and elsewhere, are of a considerable size, yet have we few instances of
its flowering, no mention being made of its time of inflorescence in the
catalogue of that collection.

From a plant, still in flower, this present December 1803, which was
literally covered with blossoms above two feet from its top, our drawing
was taken; it is in the valuable and extensive collection of Isaac
Swainson, Esq. Twickenham; which for scientific arrangement and richness
in hardy shrubs and herbaceous plants, in particular, yields to no
private or public collection we know of; and which, the extreme urbanity
of the liberal proprietor, is at all times open, to every botanist or
collector.

From the great number of new species of the divided leaved Proteas, we
are led to conjecture, that they are as numerous as those with entire
leaves. The P. decumbens, from the different specimens we have seen,
appears to branch into many varieties; some with hairy leaves and stems,
some with very close thick set leaves, and some, with both stems and
leaves, quite smooth. They are all, nevertheless, very slender stemed;
and, there is little doubt but, in their natural state, they rest on the
ground; although in the fashion we train them here, they have the
appearance of being erect. This species is found at a considerable
distance from the Cape Town, on the summits of dry sandy hills;
wherefore, it must be kept in the most airy part of the green-house, and
watered but seldom. The stem does not grow more than eighteen inches
long, and frequently flowers, as was the case in the present instance,
when not more than twelve. It is propagated, readily, from cuttings made
in the month of May, if treated in the method already directed for the
increase of these plants. The earth in which it should be planted is, a
light sandy bright loam. Our drawing was taken in the month of July,
1802, from a plant in the Hibbertian Collection, to which it was
introduced by Mr. Niven, in the year 1800.

The drawing, from which our figure of this species of Lachenalia was
taken, was made from a plant communicated by Isaac Swainson, Esq. from
his Botanic Gardens, Twickenham, Middlesex; where it is still in flower,
this present month of January, 1804; and where we believe it is only to
be met with at present in this kingdom. It is one of the largest growing
plants of the genus, the leaves when in a soil it approves attaining the
length of eighteen inches, or more. It is as hardy as any of the tribe,
very fragrant, easily preserved, increasing freely by the root, and
flowering with certainty when the bulb has become of a sufficient size.
It grows best in a mixture of light loam and peat, about two-thirds
loam, and one of peat.

Here we find another hiatus to fill up, or pass over; either a new genus
is to be formed for this plant, or we must not boggle at trifles, and
skip over one of the essential characters of Dr. Smith’s Pultenæas, the
appendicles or props at the side of the cup, which are wanting in this
plant, though agreeing in every other. We have, however, until the
Doctor shall think fit to regulate these new, numerous and intricate
genera and species from New Holland, made no scruple to add this plant,
as another species, to the genus Pultenæa. It is a low growing bushy
shrub, seldom attaining more than a foot in height; is very apt to be
destroyed by damp in winter, and is not to be propagated but by seeds,
which, however, it perfects in this country. The blossoms begin to
appear in May, and continue in succession through the summer months of
June, July, and August. It should be kept warm and dry in winter,
growing with most luxuriance in light sandy peat earth, and flowering
the second year from the seed. This plant was first raised in 1792, by
Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, at their nursery, Hammersmith, where our
drawing was taken.

All the species of this genus, yet discovered, are natives of North
America, and are considered as hardy herbaceous plants; the winters of
this country not being too severe for them; although they are found as
far south as Carolina, yet they are more plentiful in Pennsylvania,
about Philadelphia. They flourish most in a shady, moist situation; and
increase, freely, by parting the roots in the month of March. The
flowers are produced in May, the flower-stem increasing in length, till
the flowers are entirely decayed. The Helonias bullata has been an
inhabitant of our gardens ever since the year 1758, when it was
introduced by Mr. Ph. Miller, and cultivated by him at Chelsea. See
Mill. ic. 181. t. 272.

Our drawing was made at the Nursery, Hammersmith, in June 1801.

From the number of specimens in the herbarium of G. Hibbert, Esq. which
we should refer to this genus; it stands fair to rival, in number of
species, every other, natives of the Cape of Good Hope; with the
exception of Erica, Geranium, and Protea. This species has many
varieties, and we are in doubt whether this is not one from the A.
carnosa, or A. pinguis of Thunberg; for although, the cup, in the one,
may differ, in having the segments described as pointed; and in the
other, the leaves may be rather three-sided; yet, may our plant be no
more than a slight variation from either of them: but this we cannot
decide without living plants of each, for dried specimens would not
determine the fact.

This plant was introduced to the Hibbertian Collection, in 1800, by Mr.
Niven, from the Cape. It is a tender green-house plant, grows to the
height of eighteen inches, very bushy, and covers itself with flowers
about July; in which month, 1803, our drawing was taken. It has hitherto
put the ability of Mr. Allen, which is not often the case, to a stand
for a method to propagate it; but we have hopes, as most of the species
do, that it will ripen its seeds in this country.

has no properties, which regard its culture or propagation, differing
from the rest of its congeners; was sent from the Cape, by Mr. Niven, in
1800. Flowers in July. The leaves of this species have most affinity, in
appearance, to those of G. melananthum, particularly in being like them
frequently eared, and even sometimes winged. We have named it,
specifically, from the singular revolute character of the involucrum, at
the base of each bunch of flowers.

Leea and Aquilicia have, of late, been considered as not possessing
sufficient essentially differing characters to constitute two genera,
and Aquilicia has been lost in Leea. Our present subject is a species of
the former Aquilicias, is mentioned by Gaertner, who says, it approaches
A. sambucina, now Leea sambucina; to which indeed it has much
resemblance, but differs in having opposite, not alternate branches,
being scentless, having the leaves rather rough and the stem smooth. It
is a native of the East Indies, requiring the tan-bed to make it flower;
is half shrubby, and is increased by cuttings. Flowers in August. Our
figure is from a specimen communicated to us by Aylmer Bourke Lambert,
Esq. who raised it from seeds received from Dr. Roxburg, in 1801, under
the name of Leea crispa: which is a native of Africa, and has been long
in most of our collections of hot house plants, but is in the highest
state of cultivation, under the care of Mr. Hoy, in that of his Grace
the Duke of Northumberland, Sion House, near Brentford.

This pretty plant is a native of the East Indies, in that country from
which it derives its specific title. It has much affinity with many
others of the Genus, which at first sight appear rather as varieties,
than meriting to be treated as species; but, in this instance, we submit
our judgment to that of Dr. Roxburg, by whom it has been introduced to
us under the name it here bears, in the year 1802. Our figure was taken,
in the month of October 1803, from a plant in the collection of J. Vere,
Esq. Kensington Gore. The flower is scentless.

Of all the plants, numerous as they are, composing this natural Class,
we know of no one, the Virgilia (a native of Peru, and introduced to us
from the Paris gardens by Mons. Thoin, about twenty years ago, but since
lost to Europe,) excepted, which can rival our present subject. It is a
native of the Cape of Good Hope, and is said, in the Kew Catalogue, to
have been introduced to that collection, in 1774, by Mr. Masson. Whether
this is the A. paradoxa of Linn. Sp. 1307. Vol. II, we are not certain,
as the chaff, dividing the florets, is there described as of nearly the
length of the ray, giving the flower an appearance of doubleness, and is
there likewise marked as an annual. But, there is little doubt of its
being the plant intended in the Kew Catalogue, under our title; it is
there made biennial, which is its true character, as it does not flower
the first year from seeds. It may be propagated by cuttings of the first
year’s growth; delights in a light sandy loam, and flowers in July or
August. Our drawing was made in 1802, from a plant in the Hibertian
Collection; which had been raised from seeds, sent the preceding year,
from the Cape, by Mr. Niven.

Mr. Curtis, may be referred without much flexion of the original
species. We have, however, preserved the title under which it has been
known since its introduction; which was, in the year 1798, by the late
Marchioness of Bute, from Spain. Our drawing was taken from a plant in
the collection of J. Vere, Esq. Kensington Gore, in the month of
October, 1803. It has all the merits of the most easily cultivated

luxuriance in almost any earth, and requiring but little heat to make it
flower.

This plant is a native of Chili, South America, and was sent to England
by Dr. Ortega, from the Royal Gardens, Madrid, to the late Marchioness
of Bute; who first raised it from seeds in the year 1798. It is
perfectly herbaceous, but will flower the first year from the seed; will
endure moderate frost, and may be considered as a hardy herbaceous
plant. Is increased either by seeds, or by parting the roots; delights
in a moderately stiff soil; flowering from July till November. If kept
in a pot, the flowers, which are very fragrant, will continue in
succession through the whole winter.

Tagetes minuta of Linnæus’s Sp. Plant. Vol. II. p. 1250, quoted from his
Hortus Cliffortianus, and Dillenius’s Hortus Elthamensis, seems much
affined to this plant; but, as that is annual, this cannot be considered
as a variety of it.

Amongst the numerous new plants introduced from China by the late Mr.
Slater, of Laytonstone, in the year 1793, this is certainly to be
considered as amongst the most beautiful. The only drawback to its
general merit, as a hot-house plant, is the great height to which it
might attain before it flowers; being in common fourteen or fifteen
feet. It propagates by offsets, and is kept with little trouble; as it
will flourish in almost any soil, and will flower, if set in any part of
the hot-house, so as not to interrupt its growth, the blossoms being
produced only from the summit. Although with us the stem is permanent,
as with some others of the same natural habit, yet it cannot, we think,
with propriety be considered as either a tree or shrub, but rather
herbaceous. Some contention, at first, arose whether this plant should
be referred to the present Genus; which was formed, by the younger
Linnæus, from a plant a native of Surinam, S. America, some of the parts
not exactly corresponding, especially the fruit; we have nevertheless
made no scruple in placing it to that Genus, with which, upon an
inspection of the dissections, it will be found very well to accord. Our
figure was taken from a plant which flowers, annually, in the month of
July, in the Collection of J. Vere, Esq. Kensington Gore.
